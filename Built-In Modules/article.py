Built-In Modules
- Function: a separate, complete and reusable software component.
- Long and complex logic in a program is broken into smaller, independent, and reusable blocks of instructions usually called a module.
- This approach towards software development is called modular programming.

- Such a program has a main routine through which smaller independent modules (functions) are called upon.

- os module: Functions to perform many tasks of operating system
- random module: defines various functions for handling randomization
    - uses pseudo-random generator based upon Mersenne Twister algorithm that produces 53-bit precision floats.
- math module: mathematical functions
- sys module : This module provides functions and variables used to manipulate different parts of the python runtime environment
- collections module: provides alternatives to built-in container data types such as list, tuple and dict
- statistics module: provides statistical functions
- time module: time related functions
